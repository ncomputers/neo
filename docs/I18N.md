# Internationalization

This project supports menu and receipt translations for the following ISO language codes:

```
"en", "hi", "gu", "mr", "ta", "te", "kn", "ml", "bn", "pa"
```

## CSV Import Format

```
item_id,lang,name,description
1,hi,Chai,Hindi tea
```

Use `POST /api/outlet/{tenant_id}/menu/i18n/import` with the CSV file to upsert translations. Export existing translations for selected languages via `GET /api/outlet/{tenant_id}/menu/i18n/export?langs=hi,gu`.

## Onboarding

Outlets can configure a default language and the list of enabled languages. Guests may switch languages through the UI; the choice persists in a cookie for six months.

## Known Limits

* Only one language is delivered to guests at a time.
* All supported Indian languages are rendered left-to-right. Right-to-left support is not yet enabled.
