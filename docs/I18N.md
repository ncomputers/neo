# Internationalization

This project supports menu and receipt translations for the following ISO language codes:

```
"en", "hi", "gu", "mr", "ta", "te", "kn", "ml", "bn", "pa"
```

## CSV Import Format

```
item_id,lang,name,description
1,hi,Chai,Hindi tea
```

Use `POST /api/outlet/{tenant_id}/menu/i18n/import` with the CSV file to upsert translations. Export existing translations for selected languages via `GET /api/outlet/{tenant_id}/menu/i18n/export?langs=hi,gu`.

Outlet language defaults and allowed languages are managed with:

```
PATCH /api/outlet/{tenant_id}/settings/i18n
{
  "default_lang": "en",
  "enabled_langs": ["en", "hi"]
}
```

`default_lang` must be one of the values in `enabled_langs` otherwise the request is rejected with `400 default_not_enabled`.

## Onboarding

Outlets can configure a default language and the list of enabled languages. Guests may switch languages through the UI; the choice persists in a cookie for six months.

## Known Limits

* Only one language is delivered to guests at a time.
* All supported Indian languages are rendered left-to-right. Right-to-left support is not yet enabled.
* Import skips rows where the language code is not enabled for the outlet.
