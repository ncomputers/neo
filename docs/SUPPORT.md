# Support Workflows

This document outlines how owners can reach the support team and how operators handle requests.

## Workflows
- Owners file tickets or submit feedback from the admin portal.
- Staff respond through the support console.

## SLAs
Support aims to acknowledge requests within one business day and resolve critical issues within 72 hours.

## FAQ Management
Add Markdown files under `docs/faq/` to surface them in the admin support center.

## Diagnostics
When owners opt in, requests include basic context such as tenant, user and environment. Sensitive values like secrets or tokens are removed before storage.
